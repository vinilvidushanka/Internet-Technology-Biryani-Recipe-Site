                <li>Marinate the Meat:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix yogurt, coconut milk, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, <br>cumin powder, Sri Lankan roasted curry powder, salt, chopped mint, and coriander leaves.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the meat pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably be
                        <br>overnight, to allow the flavors to develop.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, bring 6-7 cups of water to a boil. Add pandan leaf, cinnamon stick, green cardamom, cloves, star anise, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Add the rice and cook until it is about 70% done (the grains should be soft but still firm). Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Cook the Marinated Meat:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot.</li>
                    <li>Add the sliced onions and fry until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the green chilies, chopped tomatoes, pandan leaves, and curry leaves. Saut√© until the tomatoes are soft and the <br>mixture is aromatic.</li>
                    <li>Add the marinated meat and cook on medium heat until the meat is tender and the oil begins to separate from <br>the gravy. This may take about 30-40 minutes depending on the type of meat used.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Layering the Biryani:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the pot with the cooked meat, spread a layer of rice on top of the meat mixture.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle some fried onions, raisins, and cashew nuts over the rice.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layers until all the rice and meat are used, finishing with a layer of rice on top.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Dum Cooking:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seal the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can seal the edges with dough to trap the steam inside.</li>
                    <li>Place the pot on low heat and cook for 30-40 minutes. Alternatively, you can place a heavy tawa (griddle) under the pot to <br>prevent direct heat and ensure even cooking.</li>
                    <li>The biryani is ready when the rice is fully cooked and has absorbed the flavors of the meat and spices.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Fluff and Serve:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers slightly.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with more fried onions, raisins, cashew nuts, and boiled eggs.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Accompaniments:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve Sri Lankan Biryani with <b>Malay Pickle, Mint Sambol, and Raita</b> to balance the rich and spicy flavors.</li>
