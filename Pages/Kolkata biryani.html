                The hallmark of Kolkata Biryani is its subtle and aromatic nature. The basmati rice is cooked with whole spices like bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon, creating a fragrant base. Tender pieces of marinated meat, typically mutton or chicken, are layered with the rice, along with boiled eggs and large chunks of potatoes that have been fried to a golden crispness. The potatoes, considered a luxurious addition during the Nawab’s time, remain an integral part of the dish, providing a rich and comforting texture.

            <ol class="OL">
                <li>Marinate the Meat:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, salt, and half of 
                        the fried onions. <br>Add the mutton or chicken to this mixture, ensuring the meat is well coated. Cover and let it marinate
                        for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight in the refrigerator.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, bring 6-7 cups of water to a boil. Add bay leaves, green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Add the rice and cook until it is about 70% done (the grains should be soft but still firm). Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Prepare the Potatoes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat mustard oil in a pan until it smokes slightly. Fry the halved potatoes until they are golden brown on the outside. Remove and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In the same oil, fry the boiled eggs until they have a light golden crust. Set them aside.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Cook the Marinated Meat:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the same pan, add a bit more oil or ghee if needed. Add the marinated meat along with any remaining marinade. Cook on medium heat until the meat is <br>tender and the oil begins to separate from the gravy. This may take 30-40 minutes for mutton and less time for chicken.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Layering the Biryani:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, spread a layer of cooked rice at the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Add a layer of the cooked meat along with some of its gravy.</li>
                    <li>Place a few fried potatoes and eggs on top.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle some biryani masala, the remaining fried onions, and a few drops of kewra water, rose water, and saffron milk.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layers until all the rice, meat, potatoes, and eggs are used, finishing with a layer of rice on top.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Dum Cooking:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seal the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can seal the edges with dough to trap the steam inside.</li>
                    <li>Place the pot on low heat and cook for 30-40 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. You can place a heavy tawa (griddle) under the pot to <br>distribute the heat evenly and prevent burning.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Serve:</li>
