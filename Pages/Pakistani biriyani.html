                Pakistani Biryani is typically made with long-grain basmati rice, marinated meat (often chicken, mutton, or beef), and a rich blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaves. What sets Pakistani Biryani apart is the generous use of chilies, both green and red, which give the dish its signature heat. The meat is marinated with yogurt, ginger, garlic, and a mix of ground spices, infusing it with deep flavors before being cooked with the rice.

                Pakistani Biryani is usually served with accompaniments like <b>Raita (a yogurt-based condiment), Salad, and Achar (spicy pickles)</b>, which balance the rich and spicy flavors of the biryani. The dish is not only a favorite across Pakistan but has also gained popularity worldwide, celebrated for its bold flavors and comforting richness.

                <li>Marinate the Meat:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, <br>garam masala powder, salt, lemon juice, chopped mint, and coriander leaves.</li>
                    <li>Add the meat pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably <br>overnight, to allow the flavors to develop.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, bring 6-7 cups of water to a boil. Add bay leaves, green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, black cumin seeds, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Add the rice and cook until it is about 70% done (the grains should be soft but still firm). Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
                </ul>
                <li> Cook the Marinated Meat:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot.</li>
                    <li>Add the whole spices (cloves, green and black cardamoms, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves) and saut√© until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Add the sliced onions and fry until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and green chilies, and cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil separates from the mixture.</li>
                    <li>Add the marinated meat and cook on medium heat until the meat is tender and the oil begins to separate from the gravy. <br>If using potatoes, add them at this stage and cook until they are almost done.</li>
                    <li>If using dried plums, add them to the mixture for a slight sweetness.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Layering the Biryani:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the same pot with the cooked meat, spread a layer of the meat mixture at the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Add a layer of the partially cooked rice on top of the meat.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle some saffron or food color over the rice, and add a few more fried onions, chopped mint, and coriander leaves.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layers until all the rice and meat are used, finishing with a layer of rice on top.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Dum Cooking:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seal the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can seal the edges with dough to trap the steam inside.</li>
                    <li>Place the pot on low heat and cook for 30-40 minutes. Alternatively, you can place a heavy tawa (griddle) under the pot <br>to prevent direct heat and ensure even cooking.</li>
                    <li>The biryani is ready when the rice is fully cooked and has absorbed the flavors of the meat and spices.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Fluff and Serve:</li>
                <Ul>
                    <li>Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers slightly.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with more fried onions, chopped coriander, and mint leaves.</li>
                </Ul>
                <li>Accompaniments:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve Pakistani Biryani with <b>Raita (a yogurt-based side dish), Salad, and Achar (spicy pickles)</b> to balance the rich and spicy flavors.</li>
