                The hallmark of Hyderabadi Biryani is its aromatic and flavorful blend of spices. Whole spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and bay leaves, along with a mix of ground spices, infuse the dish with a rich and complex flavor. The rice is often flavored with saffron or a mixture of rose and kewra (screwpine) water, adding a subtle fragrance and a golden hue to the dish.
                Traditionally, Hyderabadi Biryani is served with accompaniments like Mirchi Ka Salan <b>(a spicy chili curry)</b> and Dahi Ki Chutney <b>(a cooling yogurt-based dip)</b>, enhancing the overall dining experience.

            <ol class="OL">
                <li>Marinate the Meat:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, coriander powder, <br>lemon juice, chopped mint and coriander leaves, green chilies, fried onions, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Add the mutton or chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade.</li>
                    <li>Cover and refrigerate the meat for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to develop.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, bring 6-7 cups of water to a boil. Add bay leaves, green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, shah jeera, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Add the rice and cook until it is about 70% done (the grains should be soft but still firm). Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Cook the Marinated Meat:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat oil and ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker.</li>
                    <li>Add the marinated meat and cook on medium heat until the meat is tender and the oil begins to separate from the gravy. If using a <br>pressure cooker, cook for about 2-3 whistles. If using chicken, cook until it is just done to avoid overcooking.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Layering the Biryani:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the same pot where the meat was cooked, spread a layer of the cooked meat at the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Add a layer of the partially cooked rice on top of the meat.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle a few drops of saffron milk, rose water, and kewra water over the rice. You can also sprinkle some additional fried onions and <br>chopped mint and coriander leaves between the layers.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layers until all the rice and meat are used, finishing with a layer of rice on top.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Dum Cooking:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seal the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can seal the edges with dough to trap the steam inside.</li>
                    <li>Place the pot on low heat and cook for 30-40 minutes. Alternatively, you can place a heavy tawa (griddle) under the pot to prevent direct <br> heat and ensure even cooking.</li>
                    <li>The biryani is ready when the rice is fully cooked and has absorbed the flavors of the meat and spices.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>serve</li>
