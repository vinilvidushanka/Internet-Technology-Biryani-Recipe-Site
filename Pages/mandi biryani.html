                Mandi Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish originating from the Middle Eastern region, particularly Yemen, 
                and has gained immense popularity in South Asia, especially in India. This dish is known for its unique preparation method, 
                where basmati rice is cooked with a blend of spices, tender pieces of meat (usually chicken, mutton, or lamb), and a mix of 
                nuts and dried fruits.

                What sets Mandi Biryani apart is the use of a traditional tandoor or underground pit for cooking. The meat is marinated in a special spice mixture and then slow-cooked, allowing the flavors to seep into the meat and rice. The rice is infused with the essence of the meat and spices, creating a harmonious balance of flavors.

            <p>
                Mandi Biryani is often garnished with fried onions, boiled eggs, and a sprinkling of fresh herbs like coriander and mint, adding a final touch of freshness and color. The dish is typically served with a side of raita, salad, and sometimes a tangy tomato-based sauce, making it a complete and satisfying meal. The result is a fragrant, succulent dish that is both comforting and indulgent, making it a favorite for special occasions and gatherings.

                <li>Marinate the Meat:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine the meat with yogurt, lemon juice, salt, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, <br>garam masala, minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Mix well to coat the meat evenly.</li>
                    <li>Cover and let the meat marinate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight in the refrigerator for deeper flavor.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Cook the Meat:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven.</li>
                    <li>Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the marinated meat and cook on medium heat until the meat is browned and the spices are aromatic.</li>
                    <li>Lower the heat, cover, and cook until the meat is tender and cooked through. This may take about 30-40 minutes, <br>depending on the type of meat used.</li>

                    <li>Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and cook the rice until it is about 70% cooked.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Assemble the Mandi Biryani:</li>
                <ul>

                    <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil or a lid, and place it in the preheated oven.</li>
                    <li>Cook for 20-25 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and has absorbed the flavors of the meat.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Garnish and Serve:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once done, remove the Mandi Biryani from the oven.</li>
                    <li>Fluff the rice gently with a fork, ensuring the meat remains on top.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with fried onions, fresh coriander, mint leaves, sliced almonds, raisins, and boiled eggs if using.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot with raita, a salad, and a tangy tomato-based sauce if desired.</li>
