                    Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often 
                    associated with the region's Muslim population in particular. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the 
                    world such as in Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia. Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online 
                    food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.

            <blockquote>There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                Biriyani is a timeless and beloved dish that has captured the hearts and palates of people across the world. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, biriyani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish made with basmati rice, a variety of spices, and typically, marinated meat like chicken, mutton, or seafood. However, vegetarian versions are also popular, using ingredients like paneer, vegetables, or lentils.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                What sets biriyani apart is its unique method of cooking. The rice and meat (or vegetables) are cooked separately and then layered together, often with additional spices, fried onions, and fresh herbs, before being slow-cooked to allow the flavors to meld. This technique, known as "dum," involves sealing the pot with dough to trap the steam, resulting in a biriyani that is moist, aromatic, and bursting with flavor.
